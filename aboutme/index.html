            <p>Bien Venidos - Welcome to My-Info-Page!  I went to college a long time ago when computer science was relatively new (punch-cards, assemblers and compilers), and am now working on a refresh degree of knowledge and skills that are relevant, applicable, fulfilling and fun.
            <p>I grew up at the Grand Canyon and graduated high-school there, after which I attended college, served a mission to Argentina, attended more college and started a family with my wife Kris. We have 2 children and 2 granddaughters.
            <p>Currently I work with solar power and energy storage where I lead a team of designers and engineers using AutoCAD to produce drawings and specifications for renewable energy projects. Historically my work has been a combination of engineering, design, and project management for projects in the US and also abroad. 
            <p>It is exciting to learn more about coding for web development and applications avaiable for ongoing and future business opportunities.</p>
